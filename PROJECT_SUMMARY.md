# CollabHub Platform - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CollabHub** is a comprehensive, production-ready platform for creating, sharing, and collaborating on digital tools and content.

- **Zustand** for lightweight state management
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation

**Backend:**
- **Go (Gin framework)** for high-performance microservices
- **PostgreSQL** for primary database with proper indexing
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **RabbitMQ** for message queuing
- **JWT** for authentication and authorization
- **GORM** for database ORM

**Infrastructure:**
- **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration
- **Kong API Gateway** for routing and rate limiting
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for monitoring and alerting
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
